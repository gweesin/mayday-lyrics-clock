# Mayday Lyrics Clock

> [!WARNING]  
> WIP

A beautiful, accessible, and responsive music clock built with Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. Each second of the clock is linked to a Mayday song, and the second hand triggers playback as it moves. The project supports dark/light themes, internationalization (i18n), and is fully static with no backend required.

## Features

- **Animated Clock**: Smoothly animated hour, minute, and second hands using Framer Motion.
- **Music Integration**: 12 songs arranged around the clock; the second hand triggers playback of the corresponding song.
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both mobile and desktop.
- **Accessibility**: Follows WCAG 2.1 standards with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels.
- **Dark/Light Theme**: User can toggle between dark and light modes.
- **Internationalization**: Supports English and Chinese, with easy language switching.
- **Easy Customization**: Add or replace songs by placing audio files in the `public/songs/` directory and updating the song list in the code.
